Easy Change:
- Use f-strings more consistently (currently has some string concatenantions and f-strings)
- Add comments to abnormal evaluations
- check for empty JSON files
- Check unit test results (of how the tests are run on OUR end; all dots no F's)

Challenging Change:
- Make the code more efficient (run tests in parallel and keep files open instead of repeatedly opening and closing them)
- Send emails automatically
